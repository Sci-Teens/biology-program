Jupyter Notebooks are, at their core, environments that allow us to code and **interpret** our code in real time. Though we're using Python for this series, there are many other languages that are typically used in notebooks as well: R, Julia, and Matlab, to name a few, all support Jupyter Notebook environments. Let's check out some basic things we can do, such as addition and multiplication"
