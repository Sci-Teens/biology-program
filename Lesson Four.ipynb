    "Let's go ahead and import the necessary packages. Again, we'll go ahead and import Numpy and Pandas. This time around, we'll also be importing **SciPy**. SciPy, short for Scientific Python is a package that allows us to use scientific and mathematic tools for working with data. It works extremely well with Pandas and NumPy since it was created by the same developers. Speficically, we'll be importing the **subpackage** stats from SciPy. All a subpackage is is a package within another package. We'll import the SciPy package, and you can try importing Pandas yourself below. "
